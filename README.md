 I created a dynamic tool to monitor project progress, timelines, and resource allocation. The dashboard tracks key project metrics such as task completion rates, milestones, budget vs. actual spending, and team performance. It features interactive Gantt charts and progress bars, allowing for real-time updates and status tracking. This dashboard streamlined project oversight, reduced delays, and enabled better resource management, improving overall project efficiency and delivery times.
